Code Challenge
This repository contains the solution to the code challenge for lewis Obuba. The code challenge involves implementing functionality for three different tasks: grading student marks, calculating demerit points for speeding violations, and computing net salaries for employees.

Installation
To run the code, simply download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.

Usage
Once the index.html file is open in a web browser, the user can input values for each of the three tasks and click on the corresponding button to calculate the output. The output will be displayed on the web page.

Grading Student Marks
To grade student marks, input the mark in the input field and click on the "Grade" button. The output will display the corresponding grade (A, B, C, D, or E) based on the mark.

Calculating Demerit Points for Speeding Violations
To calculate demerit points for speeding violations, input the speed in the input field and click on the "Speed" button. The output will display either "Ok" if the speed is below 70 km/h, or the number of demerit points based on the speed (1 point per 5 km/h over the limit, up to a maximum of 12 points).

Computing Net Salaries for Employees
To compute net salaries for employees, input the salary in the input field and click on the "Salary" button. The output will display the net salary after deducting personal relief, PAYE, NSSF, and NHIF, based on the salary.
